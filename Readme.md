Create a new React app: To create a new React app, open up a terminal window and run the following command:

lua
Copy code
npx create-react-app task-manager
This will create a new React app named "task-manager" in a directory with the same name.

Install dependencies: 
Navigate to the task-manager directory and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
Copy code
npm install react-router-dom axios bootstrap
This will install React Router DOM, Axios, and Bootstrap, which are all libraries that we'll use in our app.

#Create components: Create the necessary components for your app. You can create a new folder called "components" in the src directory and create the following components:
TaskList.js: A component that displays a list of tasks.
TaskItem.js: A component that displays a single task item.
AddTask.js: A component that allows the user to add a new task.
#Create routes: Create the necessary routes for your app. You can create a new file called "Routes.js" in the src directory and define the following routes:
/: Displays the TaskList component.
/add: Displays the AddTask component.
Create a service: Create a service that will handle the API calls to your backend. You can create a new file called "TaskService.js" in the src directory and define the following functions:
getTasks(): Retrieves a list of tasks from the backend.
createTask(task): Creates a new task on the backend.
Create styles: Create the necessary styles for your app. You can create a new file called "App.css" in the src directory and define the styles for your components.

Test your app: Finally, test your app by running the following command in the terminal:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start your app in development mode and open it in a web browser. You should be able to see your task manager app in action!

I hope this helps you get started with creating your task manager app frontend using React. Good luck!
